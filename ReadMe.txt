As you may see, the first version of this Web Application was supposed to be a Campground Web Page, i tweaked it... 
Turning it into a fully functionable Restaurant Review App. 
You may see lines of code saying "campgrounds.this , campgrounds.that", actually it refers to restaurants. Didn't change that because of so much code that would have been needed to change. It is okay like this ;)
In order to START the app, navigate to the parent folder "Belgrade_RS", type in terminal node app.js.
Enjoy!
