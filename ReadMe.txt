As you may see, the first version of this Web Application was supposed to be a Campground Web Page, i tweaked it... 
Turning it into a fully functionable Restaurant Review App. 
You may see lines of code saying "campgrounds.this , campgrounds.that", actually it refers to restaurants. Didn't change that because of so much code that would have been needed to change after that. It is okay like this ;)
Before starting the App, i would note some things --> The Map is pointing to only one location on every restaurant, if needed, i will make it work for every one of them, i just wanted to represent how it would be if it was real.
In order to START the app, navigate to the parent folder "Belgrade_RS", type in terminal node app.js.
Try adding some restaurants, comments, you shall see how the app has an authorizing system and behave differently for a different users. Only the user who made a comment or new restaurant can edit/delete it.
The point of the project it to show the logic behind the App.
Enjoy!
