As you may see, the first version of this Web Application was supposed to be a Campground Web Page, i tweaked it... 
Turning it into a fully functionable Restaurant Review App. 

Before starting the App, i would note some things --> The Map is pointing to only one location on every restaurant, if needed, i will make it work for every one of them, i just wanted to represent how it would be if it was real.

In order to START the app, navigate to the parent folder "Belgrade_RS", type in terminal: npm install, then type:  node app.js

Try adding some restaurants, comments, you shall see how the app has an authorization system and behaves differently for other users. Only the user who made a comment or added a new restaurant can edit/delete it.

The point of the project is to show the logic behind the App.
Enjoy!
